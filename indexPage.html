                Hi. My name is Valentino Osorio Schwarz. I'm currently a Computer Science student who loves to code and create
                new and innovative projects.
            </p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                A few of my favourite hobbies is doing track and 
                field where my favourite events to compete in are High Jump,
                Triple Jump, 100 and 200 meter sprints. I Also love rubix cubes 
                where I love solving the 5x5 rubix cube. But I favourite hobbie 
                out of all my hobbies is codeing. I know as cringy as it is 
                codeing makes me so happy to do and lets me be super creative 
                and creates things staright from my imagnation. I started my codeing 
                jounry when I was around 13 years old, learning python as one of 
                my first programming lanuage. As any one who started to code, 
                I went to youtube and google "How to code?". I had a youtbe 
                video explaning what an IDE is and talk about how to complie code etc.
                And from the very start I was enchanteded. I wanted to learn more and more
                eventually makeing codeing my favourite hobby to do.
