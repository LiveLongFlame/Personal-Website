         <h3>Hobbies</h3>
         <body>
             A few of my favourite hobbies is doing track and 
             field where my favourite events to compete in are High Jump,
             Triple Jump, 100 and 200 meter sprints. I Also love rubix cubes 
             where I love solving the 5x5 rubix cube. But I favourite hobbie 
             out of all my hobbies is codeing. I know as cringy as it is 
             codeing makes me so happy to do and lets me be super creative 
             and creates things staright from my imagnation. I started my codeing 
             jounry when I was around 13 years old, learning python as one of 
             my first programming lanuage. As any one who started to code, 
             I went to youtube and google "How to code?". I had a youtbe 
             video explaning what an IDE is and talk about how to complie code etc.
             And from the very start I was enchanteded. I wanted to learn more and more
             eventually makeing codeing my favourite hobby to do.
